                            <p>METR's March 2025 study tracks how long a generalist frontier agent can work autonomously before its success rate drops below a chosen threshold. Their task horizon has doubled roughly every seven months since 2019, giving us a grounded baseline rather than guessing at capability curves.</p>

                            <p>The calculator loads the latest SOTA (state-of-the-art) model benchmarks from METR on each page load, using the model's release date as the capability baseline and the current date (when you access the page) as the starting point for projections. For example, GPT-5's benchmark shows a 50th percentile task horizon of 137 minutes and an 80% success horizon of 26.37 minutes. We fit a logistic success curve through those quantiles so the reliability adjustment becomes $f(r) = \exp(-\sigma\,\operatorname{logit}(r))$ with $\sigma \approx -1.19$. At the default 95% production bar the effective horizon contracts to roughly 4.1 minutes (about 33&times; shorter than the 50th percentile), and a 99% requirement would shrink it to about 0.58 minutes (~235&times; shorter).</p>

                            <ul class="detail-list">

                                <li><strong>Doubling trend:</strong> METR's doubling time drives how fast AI capability improves. Every 7 months, AI can handle 2x longer tasks at the same success rate.</li>

                                <li><strong>Reliability gate:</strong> We require 95% success before automation kicks in. Technical capability requires a high bar to outperform human error, though the calculator allows a custom reliability gate if tasks can feasibly be automated at a lower success rate.</li>

                                <li><strong>Task mapping:</strong> Your job gets decomposed into five task duration categories with gate thresholds calibrated for corporate production work: [2.5, 15, 60, 180, 540] minutes. These thresholds reflect typical workplace task decomposition. Once AI can reliably complete enough of these categories, the hazard channel opens.</li>

                                <li><strong>Scenario levers:</strong> Industry-specific friction and required reliability, plus your questionnaire responses, adjust capability but never overwrite METR's doubling - the 7-month doubling stays fixed. Friction multiplies the horizon penalty (p_domain); reliability tightens the success bar.</li>

                        <h2>What the calculator actually simulates</h2>
                        <p>The calculator models job displacement as a survival problem where multiple hazard channels compound over time. A true stacked hazard model should consider all other possibilities for displacement, including macroeconomic forces, firm-level performance, reductions in force (RIFs), non-AI displacement hazards, and personal leverage. This calculator focuses only on AI-related hazards at the role, personal, and firm levels. Consider that it is only a portion of your total displacement risk. This model will update over time with new AI-related data and risk considerations.</p>

                        <p>This parameter influences how quickly implementation barriers diminish as AI capability continues to grow. The model implements dynamic friction decay where the implementation delay decreases exponentially over time: $\Delta(t) = \Delta_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}$. At time $t$, the green curve (actual job loss) is calculated as the technical feasibility at the earlier time $t - \Delta(t)$. Higher $\lambda$ means organizational friction erodes faster (barriers collapse quickly once AI crosses initial thresholds); lower $\lambda$ means barriers persist longer even as technical capability advances. This captures how, for example, regulatory frameworks and organizational inertia may initially delay adoption by several years, but these delays shrink as AI becomes more capable and widespread adoption creates network effects.</p>

                        <h3 style='color: #2a5298; margin: 26px 0 12px 0; font-size: 1.05em;'>Role Presets</h3>
                        <p>Different roles face different automation barriers. Software engineering maps most directly to AI's training data and requires less physical presence, so it gets lower friction (1.05x). Legal work and traditional engineering involve more tacit knowledge, regulatory constraints, and liability concerns, earning higher friction multipliers (1.45&ndash;1.50x). These conservative priors reflect how far capability must stretch beyond METR's software-centric benchmarks to reach production readiness in each domain.</p>
                        <p><strong>Two-layer friction system:</strong> The model applies friction at both industry and role levels. The <em>industry-specific friction slider</em> affects all roles in a sector (e.g., finance 1.35x applies to analysts, controllers, and auditors). Your <em>questionnaire responses</em> then add role-specific friction based on tacit knowledge (Q9), physical presence (Q12), and context dependencies (Q7). Both layers multiply together in the calculation, so a high-context legal role in a regulated industry faces compounded barriers.</p>
                        <ul class='detail-list'>
                            <li><strong>Domain friction (preset baseline):</strong> Role presets set an initial friction multiplier (software ~1.05x, admin/data ~1.10x, finance/consulting ~1.35x, legal ~1.45x, engineering ~1.50x). This serves as the starting point for the role's automation difficulty before individual job characteristics are considered.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recommended reliability:</strong> Presets suggest a reliability starting point per role based on typical error tolerance and stakes (finance/legal 97&ndash;98%, software/data 92&ndash;93%, creative/customer service 88&ndash;90%). Seniority adjusts these baselines: entry-level roles tolerate slightly lower reliability (&minus;0.05), while executive decisions demand higher confidence (+0.05). Higher reliability requirements contract the effective task horizon significantly &mdash; 95% reliability shrinks capability by ~33&times;, while 98% shrinks it by ~95&times;. You can override both friction and reliability in the UI to test different scenarios.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition to the preset baseline, the calculator derives a role-specific <em>domain alignment</em> penalty from your answers. Digitized, decomposable, and standardized work (Q4/Q5/Q6 high) reduces the penalty; context dependence, tacit knowledge, judgment/relationship load, and physical presence (Q7/Q9/Q11/Q12 high) increase it. Internally, we form a signed weighted sum and map it to a penalty multiplier via an exponential, clamped to a reasonable range. This penalty multiplies with the sector slider, so misalignment compounds friction.</p>
                        <div class='equation-callout'>
                            <span class='callout-label'>AI hazard core</span>

                        </div>
                        <p>The hazard turns on once METR readiness clears the coverage bar. The model uses a <strong>two-level gating system</strong>: first, task-level gates determine which individual tasks AI can handle; second, a job-level hazard gate opens when enough of your job becomes automatable. Here's how it works:</p>
                        <ol class='action-list'>
                            <li><strong>Task-level gates open gradually:</strong> As AI capability $H_r(t)$ grows via METR's doubling trend, each task bucket's gate $G_i(H)$ opens. Short tasks automate first (gates open when $H$ exceeds their threshold $L_i$), then medium tasks, then long tasks. Your personalized weights $w_i$ determine how much each gate contributes to overall readiness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Job readiness accumulates:</strong> $A(t) = \sum w_i G_i(H)$ sums up all the open gates, weighted by your job profile. This gives a number between 0 and 1 representing what fraction of your job AI can perform.</li>
                            <li><strong>Job-level hazard gate activates:</strong> When $A(t)$ crosses the coverage threshold $\theta$ (typically 0.50), the hazard function $\lambda_{\text{AI}}(t)$ rapidly increases via the logistic gate. Before this point, hazard is near zero; after, it approaches the maximum $h_{\max} \times M_{\text{user}}$.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <div class='equation-callout'>
                            <span class='callout-label'>Task horizon</span>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$H_r(t) = \frac{H_{50,0} \cdot 2^{(t \cdot 12)/D}}{f(r)}$$</div>
                        </div>
                        <p>This structure means automation doesn't happen all at once. AI steadily masters more of your tasks (task gates opening), but job displacement risk only spikes once AI can handle enough of your role to justify replacement (job gate opening). Jobs with more long-duration tasks take longer to reach this threshold.</p>
                        <ul class='detail-list'>
                            <li><strong>Task horizon $H_r(t)$:</strong> $$H_r(t) = \frac{H_{50,0} \cdot 2^{(t \cdot 12)/D}}{f(r)}$$ where $D = 7$ months is METR's doubling period (fixed). $f(r)$ is the reliability factor: higher reliability requirements divide $H$, reducing AI's effective maximum task length. At the default 95% reliability, $f(0.95) \approx 33.4$, contracting the 50th percentile horizon (137 min) down to about 4.1 minutes for production use.</li>

                            <li><strong>Personalized task weights $w_i$:</strong> Your answers to Q5 (task decomposability), Q6 (task standardization), Q7 (context dependency), and your seniority level determine how your job breaks down across the five buckets. Entry-level roles skew toward shorter tasks (quick emails, simple coding); executive roles skew toward longer tasks (strategic planning, integration work). Highly structured jobs (Q5=5) concentrate weight in the short buckets; complex jobs (Q5=1) shift weight to longer buckets. High-context work (Q7=5) means fewer quick wins and more integrated effort, so the model assigns more weight to the 1&ndash;3 hr and &gt;9 hr buckets. The weights always sum to 1.0 and determine what fraction of your job falls into each duration category. Additionally, the gate softness parameter (which controls how sharply tasks transition from "AI can't do this" to "AI can do this") also varies by seniority and task complexity: entry-level structured work has sharper transitions, while senior complex work has smoother, more gradual automation curves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Readiness $A_{\text{job}}(t)$:</strong> $$A_{\text{job}}(t) = \sum_i w_i G_i(H_r(t))$$ This weighted sum tells us what fraction of your job AI can perform at time $t$. If you're an entry-level role with 40% of tasks under 5 minutes and AI's capability $H_r(t)$ has reached 10 minutes, the &lt;5 min gate is fully open ($G_1 \approx 1.0$), contributing $0.40 \times 1.0 = 0.40$ to readiness. Jobs with more long-duration tasks need higher $H_r$ before their readiness $A(t)$ crosses the coverage threshold $\theta$, delaying automation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coverage bar $\theta$:</strong> Baseline $0.50$ shifts based on multiple factors. Data-rich jobs (Q2), standardized workflows (Q6), and fast feedback loops (Q8) <strong>lower</strong> $\theta$ because automation becomes viable at lower AI capability levels (easier to specify, validate, and deploy). Conversely, tacit knowledge, high context, and compliance-heavy roles push $\theta$ upward before hazard activates. Range: $[0.35, 0.72]$. The hard upper bound of $0.72$ represents the theoretical maximum coverage threshold, though in practice most roles reach a ceiling around $0.68$ with extreme scores on protective factors. This gate controls how much of the job must be automatable before displacement risk activates.</li>
                            <li><strong>User multipliers $M_{\text{user}}(s)$:</strong> Questionnaire responses exponentiate into amplifier and friction sums, then are capped between $0.33\times$ and $3\times$ for responsiveness.</li>

                        <h2>How your answers move the curve</h2>
                        <p>Each questionnaire response maps to a coded value $x_i$. All responses use the same coding rule: Likert 1-5 responses convert to the symmetric set $\{-2,-1,0,+1,+2\}$ (i.e., $1\to -2, 3\to 0, 5\to +2$). Effects run in the correct direction via the weight's sign. The model tracks two channels: an amplifier sum $\sum w_{\text{amp}} x_i$ and a friction sum $\sum w_{\text{fric}} x_i$. After clamping each sum to $[-2, 2]$ we exponentiate them, multiply the results, then bound the overall multiplier to $[0.33, 3.0]$ for responsiveness.</p>
                        <p>The prompts cluster into four themes:</p>
                        <ul class='detail-list'>
                            <li><strong>AI readiness (Q1-Q4):</strong> High scores strengthen the amplifier channel when you indicate strong capability for AI learning and completing your tasks. Additionally, Q1 (current AI performance), Q2 (data availability), Q3 (benchmark clarity), and Q4 (task digitization) all contribute to role explicitness ($s_e$), which lowers the coverage threshold $\theta$ &mdash; making automation viable at lower overall capability levels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Task structure (Q5&ndash;Q9):</strong> These questions affect the blue curve (technical feasibility) through multiple mechanisms: <strong>(1)</strong> Q5, Q6 shift the task duration profile (structured &rarr; shorter buckets, complex &rarr; longer buckets), <strong>(2)</strong> Q2, Q5, Q6, Q8 contribute to $s_e$ which <strong>lowers $\theta$</strong> (data-rich, decomposable, standardized, fast-feedback jobs become viable at lower capability), and <strong>(3)</strong> Q7, Q9 increase the domain penalty $p_{\text{domain}}$ (high context, tacit knowledge damp capability) &mdash; they do <em>not</em> change the doubling time. Together, these determine when your specific job crosses the automation threshold.</li>
                            <li><strong>Human moat (Q11-Q12):</strong> Relationship intensity and physical presence both load the friction side and stretch the METR baseline via the domain penalty, pushing the curve out.</li>
                            <li><strong>Firm and personal context (Q13-Q19):</strong> Company levers shape implementation delay. Job performance (Q19) delays displacement for top performers while also helping re-employment. Adaptability (Q18) and transferability (Q17) drive re-employment probability.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Role explicitness ($s_e$) mechanism:</strong> Questions Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, and Q8 (positive factors) are averaged together, while Q7 and Q9 (context dependency and tacit knowledge &mdash; protective factors) are averaged separately. The formula $s_e = 0.65 \times \text{norm}(s_{\text{pos}}) - 0.35 \times \text{norm}(s_{\text{neg}}) + 0.10$ produces a score between 0 and 1. Higher $s_e$ (more explicit roles) reduces $\theta$ via the shift $\Delta_{s_e} = 0.10 \times (0.5 - s_e)$, meaning AI needs less total job coverage before automation becomes economically viable.</p>

                        <p>The model also adjusts the gate steepness $\gamma$ based on task characteristics. Structured work, fast feedback, and standardized tasks sharpen the S-curve; messy, collaborative, or bespoke work flattens it. This captures whether adoption snaps into place once the threshold is crossed or grinds along for years.</p>

                        <h2>The green curve: Implementation delay and workforce compression</h2>

                        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The green curve (actual job loss) differs from the blue curve (technical feasibility) through two distinct mechanisms that combine to determine when your job is actually at risk. The blue curve shows when AI <em>can</em> do the job technically. The green curve shows when job loss <em>actually occurs</em>, accounting for both organizational adoption barriers and earlier compression-driven workforce reductions.</p>

                        <h3 style='margin: 32px 0 16px 0;'>How the green curve is calculated</h3>

                        <p>The model integrates two separate hazard channels to create the green curve:</p>

                        <div class='equation-callout'>
                            <span class='callout-label'>Green curve total hazard</span>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$\lambda_{\text{total}}(t) = \lambda_{\text{AI}}(t - \Delta(t)) + \lambda_{\text{compression}}(t)$$</div>
                            <span class='callout-label'>Where implementation delay decreases over time</span>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$\Delta(t) = \Delta_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}$$</div>
                        </div>

                        <p>This structure captures two different ways jobs disappear:</p>

                        <ul class='detail-list'>
                            <li><strong>Delayed automation hazard:</strong> The AI automation hazard $\lambda_{\text{AI}}$ is evaluated at an earlier time $(t - \Delta(t))$ due to organizational friction. Early in the timeline, implementation barriers create a significant delay ($\Delta_0$), but this delay shrinks exponentially as AI capability grows and adoption accelerates. The friction decay rate $\lambda$ determines how fast these barriers collapse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compression hazard:</strong> A separate hazard channel $\lambda_{\text{compression}}(t)$ that activates when AI makes senior workers productive enough to absorb junior work. This hazard is evaluated at the current time $t$ (no delay) and can cause job loss well before full automation becomes technically feasible. The two hazards are summed and capped at 0.60/year total.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 style='margin: 32px 0 16px 0;'>Mechanism 1: Implementation delay (shifts automation hazard forward)</h3>

                        <p>Organizational barriers slow the adoption of AI automation. The initial delay $\Delta_0$ derives from company context (Q13-Q16: adoption appetite, labor cost pressure, market tightness, infrastructure) and individual leverage (Q19: job performance protects top performers). This delay starts between 0.3 and 4.0 years depending on your situation.</p>

                        <div class='equation-callout'>
                            <span class='callout-label'>Initial delay calculation</span>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$\Delta_0 = \operatorname{clip}\big(1.75 - 1.25\, s_{\text{delay}} + \Delta^{\text{eff}}_{\text{seniority}},\; 0.3,\; 4.0\big)$$</div>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$\Delta^{\text{eff}}_{\text{seniority}} = \Delta_{\text{seniority}} \cdot \Big[1 + 0.5\, (\operatorname{norm}(Q19) - 0.5)\, \operatorname{sign}(\Delta_{\text{seniority}})\Big]$$</div>
                            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 8px; color: #666;">$s_{\text{delay}} \in [-2,2]$ from Q13-Q16; $\Delta_{\text{seniority}} \in \{-0.25,-0.05,+0.10,+0.20,+0.30\}$ by level</p>
                        </div>

                        <p><strong>Dynamic friction decay:</strong> The delay doesn't stay constant. As AI capability increases and adoption spreads, organizational barriers erode exponentially: $\Delta(t) = \Delta_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}$. The decay rate $\lambda$ (typically 0.02-0.05/year) is inferred from your answers about adoption readiness, infrastructure, and role characteristics. Higher $\lambda$ means barriers collapse faster once AI crosses initial thresholds; lower $\lambda$ means delays persist even as capability advances.</p>

                        <p><strong>Example delays:</strong> An early-adopting entry-level role (s_delay = +2, $\Delta_{\text{seniority}}$ = -0.25) starts with $\Delta_0 \approx 0.3$ years. A defensive environment with senior leadership (s_delay = -2, $\Delta_{\text{seniority}}$ = +0.30) starts with $\Delta_0 \approx 4.0$ years. Performance (Q19) modulates these: high performers get extended delays; low performers face shortened timelines.</p>

                        <h3 style='margin: 32px 0 16px 0;'>Mechanism 2: Workforce compression (earlier job loss via task reallocation)</h3>

                        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Jobs can be eliminated well before AI reaches full automation capability. When AI makes senior workers more productive, companies can reduce headcount by redistributing work upward in the hierarchy. An entry-level software engineer's role might disappear when AI can only handle 35% of their tasks &mdash; not because AI does everything, but because AI-amplified senior engineers can absorb the remaining 65%.</p>

                        <p>The compression hazard activates earlier and at a lower threshold than full automation. It depends on three factors:</p>

                        <div class='equation-callout'>
                            <span class='callout-label'>Compression hazard</span>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$\lambda_{\text{compression}}(t) = \frac{h_{\max,c}}{1 + \exp(-\gamma_c (R_c(t) - \theta_c))} \cdot V_{\text{hierarchy}}$$</div>
                            <span class='callout-label'>Where compression readiness uses a hybrid formula:</span>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$R_c(t) = s_{\text{realloc}} \times \big(0.7 + 0.3(1 + B_{\text{amp}})\big)$$</div>
                            <span class='callout-label'>And amplification boost is:</span>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$B_{\text{amp}} = f_{\text{effective}} \cdot A_{\text{job}}(t) \cdot \text{norm}(Q1) \cdot 2.0$$</div>
                            <span class='callout-label'>Where effective digital fraction accounts for AI learnability:</span>
                            <div class='equation-display'>$$f_{\text{effective}} = \text{norm}(Q4) \times \max\big(0.1,\, 1 - 0.35\,\text{norm}(Q7) - 0.30\,\text{norm}(Q9) - 0.20\,(1{-}\text{norm}(Q5)) - 0.15\,(1{-}\text{norm}(Q6))\big)$$</div>
                        </div>

                        <p>The <strong>hybrid formula</strong> means compression readiness has two components: 70% comes from reallocation feasibility alone (immediate effect), and 30% grows over time as AI amplifies senior productivity. This ensures Q10 has a noticeable immediate impact while preserving the time-dependent behavior where compression risk accelerates as AI becomes more capable.</p>

                        <ol class='action-list'>
                            <li><strong>Reallocation feasibility ($s_{\text{realloc}}$):</strong> Combines Q10 (direct reallocation question: <strong>50% weight</strong>), task structure (Q5: 18%, Q6: 12%, Q7: 8% inverted), tacit knowledge (Q9: 10% inverted), and physical presence (Q12: 2% inverted). Q10 is the dominant factor since it directly measures how easily your responsibilities could be redistributed to existing team members. Higher scores mean your work can be easily absorbed by others. Range: [0, 1].</li>
                            <li><strong>Senior productivity amplification ($B_{\text{amp}}$):</strong> AI only amplifies productivity for work that is both digital <em>and</em> AI-learnable. Raw digitization (Q4) is discounted by factors that make digital work harder for AI to learn from: context dependency (Q7: 35% weight), tacit knowledge (Q9: 30% weight), low decomposability (Q5: 20% weight), and low standardization (Q6: 15% weight). A senior consultant whose deliverables are 100% digital but require extensive context, relationships, and tacit judgment gets minimal amplification—the work is digital, but AI can't learn to replicate it by observing outputs. Conversely, highly digital, standardized, decomposable work with low context enables strong amplification. The boost ranges from 0 to 2.0 (up to +200% output; up to 3&times; productivity when used in $(1 + B_{\text{amp}})$), scaled by current AI performance (Q1) and job readiness $A_{\text{job}}(t)$. This factor grows over time as AI capability increases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hierarchy vulnerability ($V_{\text{hierarchy}}$):</strong> Your position in the workflow determines exposure. Calculated as $(6 - \text{level}) / 5$. Level 1 (many layers above) = 100% vulnerable. Level 4 = 40% vulnerable. Level 5 (top of domain, no one above can do your work) = 20% vulnerable. A principal engineer who owns a system faces minimal compression risk despite being in a "senior" role title.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><strong>Parameters differ from full automation:</strong> The compression gate opens at $\theta_c = 0.35$ (vs. $\theta \approx 0.50$ for automation), has gentler slope ($\gamma_c = 6.0$ vs. $\gamma = 8.0$), and lower maximum hazard ($h_{\max,c} = 0.30$/year vs. $h_{\max} = 0.40$/year). Combined with automation hazard, the total is capped at 0.60/year to reflect real-world institutional friction that prevents instant mass layoffs.</p>

                        <h3 style='margin: 32px 0 16px 0;'>Examples: How the mechanisms interact</h3>

                        <p><strong>Example 1 (high compression risk): Entry-level SWE.</strong> Level 1 with highly decomposable digital work (Q4=5, Q5=4, Q6=4, Q7=2, Q9=2, Q10=4). Reallocation score = 0.50×0.75 + 0.18×0.75 + 0.12×0.75 + 0.08×0.75 + 0.10×0.75 + 0.02×0 = 0.70. Raw digital = 1.0; learnability discount = 1 - (0.35×0.25 + 0.30×0.25 + 0.20×0.25 + 0.15×0.25) = 0.75; effective digital = 0.75. At 40% job readiness with Q1=3: AI capability = 0.20; amplification boost = 0.75 × 0.20 × 2.0 = 0.30. Compression readiness = 0.70 × (0.7 + 0.3×1.3) = 0.70 × 0.89 = 0.62. Base compression hazard $\approx$ 0.21/year. Hierarchy vulnerability = 1.0 &rarr; final compression hazard $\approx$ 0.21/year. This activates early and grows as AI improves, causing the green curve to show significant job loss risk 2-3 years earlier than the blue curve predicts.</p>

                        <p><strong>Example 2 (protected): Senior consultant with digital deliverables but high context/tacit needs.</strong> Level 4, fully digital (Q4=5), low decomposability (Q5=2), low standardization (Q6=2), hard to reallocate (Q10=2), high tacit/context (Q7=5, Q9=5), normal physical presence (Q12=3). Reallocation score = 0.50×0.25 + 0.18×0.25 + 0.12×0.25 + 0.08×0 + 0.10×0 + 0.02×0.50 = 0.23. Raw digital = 1.0; learnability discount = 1 - (0.35×1.0 + 0.30×1.0 + 0.20×0.75 + 0.15×0.75) = max(0.1, -0.01) = 0.1 (floor applied); effective digital = 0.10. Even with Q1=3 and job readiness 0.40: amplification boost = 0.10 × 0.20 × 2.0 = 0.04. Compression readiness = 0.23 × (0.7 + 0.3×1.04) = 0.23 × 0.77 = 0.18, well below the 0.35 threshold. Hierarchy vulnerability (Level 4) = 0.4 &rarr; compression hazard $\approx$ near zero. Outcome: protected by the combination of low reallocation score, high learnability penalties (work is digital but not AI-trainable), and hierarchy position &mdash; compression risk is negligible; main risk comes from much later full automation.</p>

                        <p><strong>Example 3 (moderate): Entry-level accountant.</strong> Level 1; mostly digital (Q4=4), moderate structure (Q5=3, Q6=3), moderate context/tacit (Q7=3, Q9=3), reallocation moderate (Q10=3). Reallocation score = 0.50×0.50 + 0.18×0.50 + 0.12×0.50 + 0.08×0.50 + 0.10×0.50 + 0.02×0.50 = 0.50. Raw digital = 0.75; learnability discount = 1 - (0.35×0.5 + 0.30×0.5 + 0.20×0.5 + 0.15×0.5) = 0.50; effective digital = 0.75 × 0.50 = 0.375. At $A_{\text{job}} = 0.40$ and Q1=3: amplification boost = 0.375 × 0.20 × 2.0 = 0.15. Compression readiness = 0.50 × (0.7 + 0.3×1.15) = 0.50 × 0.845 = 0.42. Base hazard $\approx$ 0.11/year. Hierarchy vulnerability = 1.0 &rarr; compression hazard $\approx$ 0.11/year. Outcome: moderate compression risk with activation above threshold, growing as AI capability increases.</p>

                        <h3 style='margin: 32px 0 16px 0;'>Re-employment probability</h3>

                        <p>Re-employment odds derive from adaptability questions. The model starts at 60% baseline, adjusts based on transferable skills (Q17), learning speed (Q18), and job performance (Q19) with a scaling factor of 0.2 per weighted point, subtracts a timing penalty if displacement occurs soon, and then applies the seniority boost from the profile (roughly +0% to +10%). The result is clamped between 10% and 85% &mdash; no one is guaranteed, but no one is written off.</p>

                        <p><strong>Timing penalty (graduated scale):</strong> If the median technical feasibility hazard occurs within a shorter timeframe, re-employment becomes more difficult due to market saturation. The penalty is a probability reduction applied as follows: median &lt; 3 years: $-0.30$; 3-7 years: $-0.15$; 7-12 years: $-0.05$; &gt;12 years: $0$ (no penalty). This reflects the difficulty of finding alternative employment when many similar roles are being automated simultaneously.</p>

                        <div class='insight-callout'>
                            <p><strong>Protection mechanisms (user-actionable):</strong> Move up hierarchy: reach Level 4–5 (own a domain/system) to reduce compression vulnerability. Increase specialization: lower Q10 (make work harder to transfer to others). Increase tacit/context: raise Q7 and Q9 (context-dependent, experiential work). Reduce digitization overlap: lower Q4 where genuine (hybrid/physical workflows weaken AI amplification). Build unique relationships: strengthen Q11/Q12 protective value. Strengthen performance: raise Q19 to increase implementation delay and re-employment odds.</p>

                        <h2>Reading the outputs</h2>
                        <p>The chart shows two survival complements: blue for technical feasibility and green for realized displacement once friction and delay kick in. Because we integrate $\lambda(s)$ with Simpson's rule, the area under each curve is the cumulative probability that automation has already happened.</p>
                        <ul class='detail-list'>
                            <li><strong>Median timeline:</strong> We use a binary search to find the year where cumulative probability hits $50\%$. That becomes the headline median job-loss metric.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk by 2030 or 2031:</strong> The model calculates years from the current date (when you access the page) to these target years, then evaluates $P_{\text{loss}}$ at that future horizon. For example, accessing the calculator in October 2025 means 2030 is ~4.2 years away. This ensures projections stay relevant as time passes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal timeline:</strong> We surface the $25\%$, $50\%$, $75\%$, and $90\%$ milestones when they fall within the next $10$, $15$, $18$, and $25$ years respectively so you can see the near-term thresholds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Re-employment label:</strong> The probability is bucketed into Good, Moderate, Low, or Very Low for quick scanning, with the precise percentage alongside.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Use the controls to stress-test assumptions. METR's doubling is fixed. Higher <em>industry-specific friction</em> increases the horizon penalty $p_{\text{domain}}$ (not the doubling time), and stricter <em>reliability</em> requirements reduce the effective task horizon. Answers that raise role explicitness $s_e$ or ease the coverage bar $\theta$ pivot curves left, while higher rollout friction $\lambda$ or stubborn implementation drag pushes the green curve out. High scores on Q7&ndash;Q13 increase $p_{\text{domain}}$, so even at the METR trend, capability must cover more ground before matching software baselines.</p>

                            <li>Start with the preset that feels closest to your role, then tweak one cluster of questions at a time so you can see which dimensions move the hazard.</li>
                            <li>Stress-test the extremes: set AI readiness to five while leaving friction high, then flip it. The distance between those runs is a map of where to invest your energy.</li>
                            <li>Pair the re-employment score with the green curve. A fast hazard plus weak re-employment is the trigger for upskilling or a job search; a slow hazard plus strong re-employment buys time for deliberate moves.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Use the weight structure as a checklist: strengthen the protective items you can influence, document the assumptions you cannot, and revisit the calculator as real-world signals shift.</p>
