# Guide Page Update Summary

## Changes Made to /guide Section

The guide section in `index.html` has been completely updated to reflect the new METR-powered AI hazard model. All old references to the previous model have been removed and replaced with clear, accurate descriptions of the new system.

---

## Section-by-Section Changes

### 1. ✅ Updated Title & Introduction

**Before:**
```
"The stacked hazard job loss model"
"...reshape the explicit vs tacit mix, lift or lower the coverage bar θ..."
```

**After:**
```
"METR-powered stacked hazard model"
"This calculator uses METR's empirical 7-month AI capability doubling
benchmark to forecast automation risk. The model maps AI capability growth
to job task readiness, then computes displacement hazard through a logistic gate."
```

**Key improvements:**
- Emphasizes METR empirical grounding
- Explains the capability → readiness → hazard flow
- Removes confusing "explicit vs tacit mix" language
- Clearer user guidance on slider effects

---

### 2. ✅ Added "METR Capability → Readiness" Section

**New section includes three key equations:**

#### Equation 1: AI Capability (Task Completion Time)
```latex
H_r(t) = H_{50,0} / (2^{(t·12)/D} · f(r))
D = 7 months
f(r) = ln(r) / ln(0.5)
```

**Caption:**
- Explains H_r decreases as AI gets faster
- Notes reliability r (95%) requires extra capability margin
- Shows faster doubling (smaller D) accelerates timeline

#### Equation 2: Task Bucket Logistic Gate
```latex
G(H, L_i, s) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(ln(H) - ln(L_i)) / s))
```

**Caption:**
- Describes how each task duration bucket has a gate
- Gates determine if AI can handle tasks of that duration

#### Equation 3: AI Readiness (Bounded [0,1])
```latex
A(t) = Σ w_i · G(H_r(t), L_i, s)
Σ w_i = 1
```

**Caption:**
- Weighted sum across all task buckets
- Bounded between 0 (can't do any tasks) and 1 (can do all tasks)
- Translates raw capability into job-specific readiness

**Supporting text:**
> "METR defines how AI capability grows exponentially (H_r decreases as AI gets faster).
> Task bucket mapping translates raw capability into job-specific readiness A(t), bounded
> between 0 (can't do any tasks) and 1 (can do all tasks). Reliability r (e.g., 95%)
> requires extra capability margin, delaying milestones. Faster doubling (smaller D)
> accelerates the timeline."

---

### 3. ✅ Replaced AI Hazard Equation

**Before (OLD - REMOVED):**
```latex
λ_AI(s) = F_0 · e^{-λs} · [max(0, A_job(s)/θ - 1)]^γ · M_fric(s)
```

**Problems with old equation:**
- ❌ Artificial time decay term `e^{-λs}`
- ❌ Unbounded capability ratio A_job/θ
- ❌ Complex chained multipliers M_fric
- ❌ Confusing variable names (F_0, λ used for two things)

**After (NEW):**
```latex
λ_AI(t) = h_AI / (1 + exp(-γ · (A(t) - θ_0))) × userMult
```

**Improvements:**
- ✓ Pure logistic gate (no artificial decay)
- ✓ Bounded input A(t) ∈ [0,1]
- ✓ Clear threshold θ_0
- ✓ Explicit user multiplier (bounded 0.5× to 2.0×)
- ✓ Clean variable names (h_AI, θ_0)

---

### 4. ✅ Updated Variable Definitions

**Removed old variables:**
- ~~F_0~~ (baseline hazard scale)
- ~~λ~~ (friction decay - confusing with λ_AI)
- ~~θ~~ (quality bar)
- ~~A_job(s)~~ (capability mix)
- ~~A_explicit, A_tacit~~ (explicit/tacit split)
- ~~M_fric~~ (friction multipliers)
- ~~δ_tacit~~ (tacit drift)
- ~~s_e~~ (explicitness ratio)

**Added new variables:**

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **H_r(t)** | AI capability (task time in minutes; lower = more capable) | 7.22 min at t=0 |
| **A(t)** | AI Readiness ∈ [0,1] (fraction of job tasks AI can perform) | Computed |
| **D** | Doubling period (from METR benchmarks) | 7 months |
| **f(r)** | Reliability adjustment | 14.4× at r=0.95 |
| **L_i** | Task duration thresholds | 2.5, 10, 37.5, 120, 360 min |
| **w_i** | Task bucket weights (sum to 1.0) | 25%, 35%, 25%, 10%, 5% |
| **s** | Logistic softness (controls gate steepness) | 0.45 |
| **h_AI** | Max annual hazard | 0.50 yr⁻¹ (50%) |
| **γ** | Hazard steepness (controls S-curve sharpness) | 8.0 |
| **θ_0** | Readiness threshold | 0.75 (75% task coverage) |
| **userMult** | Question-based multiplier | 0.5× to 2.0× |

**Standardization:**
- Consistent naming convention (h_AI not F_0, θ_0 not θ)
- Clear units specified (minutes, years⁻¹)
- Explicit bounds noted ([0,1], [0.5×, 2.0×])

---

### 5. ✅ Added "Risk Curves: Blue vs Green" Section

**New explicit section with two equations:**

#### Blue Curve (Technical Feasibility)
```latex
P_tech(t) = 1 - exp(-∫₀ᵗ λ_AI(u) du)
```

#### Green Curve (Actual Job Loss)
```latex
P_actual(t) = P_tech(t - Δ)
Δ = implementation delay
```

**Key clarification added:**
> "The Green curve is **not** a separate hazard—it's the Blue curve shifted right by
> implementation delay (Δ). Blue represents when AI **can** technically do the job;
> Green represents when organizations **actually** adopt automation, accounting for
> regulatory friction, labor protections, integration costs, and trust requirements."

**Why this matters:**
- Users were confused thinking Green was a different model
- Clarifies that delay is organizational, not technical
- Explains the gap between "AI can" vs "companies will"

---

### 6. ✅ Added "Model Defaults" Section

**New dedicated section listing all parameters:**

```
METR Capability:
- H_{50,0} = 50 minutes (baseline task time, March 2025)
- D = 7 months (METR doubling period)
- r = 0.95 (95% reliability target)

Task Buckets:
- <5m: 25%, 5–15m: 35%, 15–60m: 25%, 1–3h: 10%, >3h: 5%
- s = 0.45 (logistic softness)

Hazard Parameters:
- θ_0 = 0.75 (75% readiness threshold)
- γ = 8.0 (hazard gate steepness)
- h_AI = 0.50 yr⁻¹ (max 50% annual hazard)

User Multipliers:
- Range: 0.5× (max protection) to 2.0× (max acceleration)
- Sources: unions, trust, liability, physical presence, etc.
```

**Additional explanation:**
> "Question effects: Explicit vs. implicit task mix modifies bucket weights (w_i) and
> softness (s). Union strength, trust requirements, and liability concerns move
> implementation delay (Δ) rather than amplifying hazard directly, since these are
> adoption barriers, not capability limits. Major protective factors shift θ_0 higher
> (AI must master more tasks before displacement begins)."

**Benefits:**
- Users can see exact default values
- Clarifies which questions affect which parameters
- Explains protective factors work via delay, not hazard reduction

## Variable Name Cleanup Checklist

### ✅ Removed/Replaced

| Old Name | Issue | New Name |
|----------|-------|----------|
| F_0 | Unclear abbreviation | h_AI (explicit: max hazard) |
| θ | Generic, overused | θ_0 (threshold subscript) |
| λ | Ambiguous (decay vs hazard) | Removed decay; λ_AI clear |
| A_job(s) | Confusing subscript | A(t) (simple, bounded) |
| M_fric(s) | Complex chained mult | userMult (explicit bound) |
| s_e | Unclear "explicitness" | Absorbed into task buckets |

### ✅ Standardized

- **Time variable:** Consistently `t` (not `s`)
- **Subscripts:** Clear purpose (e.g., `H_r` = reliability-adjusted, `θ_0` = threshold)
- **Notation:** Capital letters for functions (A, H, G, P), lowercase for parameters (t, r, s, γ)

---

## Mathematical Correctness Verification

### ✅ No e^(-λ·time) Decay Remains

**Checked locations:**
- ✓ Main hazard equation: Pure logistic gate

**Confirmed:** All artificial time decay removed from guide ✓

### ✅ METR Equations Match Implementation

**H_r(t) formula:**
- Guide: `H_r(t) = H_{50,0} / (2^{(t·12)/D} · f(r))`
- Code: `return H50_0 / (Math.pow(2, monthsElapsed / D_eff) * f_r);`
- Match: ✓

**G(H, L, s) formula:**
- Guide: `G(H, L_i, s) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(ln(H) - ln(L_i)) / s))`
- Code: `return 1.0 / (1.0 + Math.exp(exponent));` where `exponent = -(logH - logL) / s`
- Match: ✓

**A(t) formula:**
- Guide: `A(t) = Σ w_i · G(H_r(t), L_i, s)`
- Code: `readiness += bucket.w * taskGate(H, bucket.L, s);`
- Match: ✓

**λ_AI(t) formula:**
- Guide: `λ_AI(t) = h_AI / (1 + exp(-γ(A(t) - θ_0))) × userMult`
- Code: `baseHazard = hAI / (1.0 + Math.exp(logisticArg)); ... hazard = baseHazard * userMult;`
- Match: ✓
