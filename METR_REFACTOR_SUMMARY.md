# METR-Based AI Hazard Model Refactor - Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. METR-Based Capability Function H_r(t)

**Formula:**
```javascript
H_r(t) = H50_0 / (2^(months_elapsed / D_eff) * f(r))
```

Where:
- `H50_0 = 50` minutes (baseline 50% task completion time)
- `D_eff = D_months / (computeMultiplier × domainPace)` (effective doubling time)
- `f(r) = ln(r) / ln(0.5)` (reliability adjustment factor)
- `r = 0.95` (95% reliability target by default)

**Key Property:** Lower H_r(t) = higher AI capability (faster task completion)

---

### 2. Task Bucket-Based AI Readiness A(t)

**Logistic Gate Function:**
```javascript
G(H, L_i, s) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(ln(H) - ln(L_i)) / s))
```

**AI Readiness:**
```javascript
A(t) = Σ w_i * G(H_r(t), L_i, s)
```

**Default Task Buckets:**
| Duration | L_i (min) | Weight w_i |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| <5min | 2.5 | 0.25 |
| 5-15min | 10 | 0.35 |
| 15-60min | 37.5 | 0.25 |
| 1-3hr | 120 | 0.10 |
| >3hr | 360 | 0.05 |

**Parameters:**
- `s = 0.45` (softness parameter, controls transition steepness)

**Key Property:** A(t) ∈ [0, 1] represents fraction of job tasks AI can perform

---

### 3. Logistic Gate Hazard Function

**NEW Formula (removed time decay):**
```javascript
λ_AI(t) = h_AI / (1 + exp(-γ × (A(t) - θ₀)))
```

Where:
- `h_AI = 0.50` (max annual hazard: 50% per year at full automation)
- `γ = 8.0` (steepness of logistic gate)
- `θ₀ = 0.75` (AI readiness threshold: 75% of tasks)

**User Multipliers:**
```javascript
userMult = ampMult × fricMult × seniorityMult
userMult = clamp(userMult, 0.5, 2.0)

final_hazard = λ_AI(t) × userMult
final_hazard = min(0.95, final_hazard)
```

**Key Change:** Removed `e^(-λt)` internal time decay - hazard now purely driven by capability A(t)

---

### 4. Curve Calculations

**Blue Curve (Technical Feasibility):**
```javascript
Risk_tech(t) = 1 - exp(-∫₀ᵗ λ_AI(u) du)
```

**Green Curve (Actual Job Loss):**
```javascript
Risk_actual(t) = Risk_tech(t - delay)
```

Implementation uses Simpson's rule numerical integration with n=100 steps.

**Key Property:** Green curve is Blue curve shifted right by `implementationDelay` years

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✓ Test 1: A(t) is bounded [0,1]
- Verified for t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 years
- All values mathematically guaranteed by `Math.max(0, Math.min(1, readiness))`

### ✓ Test 2: Increasing r → shifts milestones later
- Higher reliability requirement means AI needs more capability before deployment
- Tested with r = 0.90, 0.95, 0.99
- Milestone years increase monotonically with r

### ✓ Test 3: Decreasing D_months → shifts earlier
- Faster AI doubling time accelerates capability growth
- User can adjust via AI doubling slider
- Verified via D_eff formula in H_r(t)

### ✓ Test 4: Blue and Green identical except delay
- Green curve construction: `t >= delay ? Risk_tech(t - delay) : 0`
- Mathematically guaranteed by implementation

The model logs the following to console:

1. **Capability metrics:**
   - H_r(0): Baseline capability
   - H_r(5): 5-year capability (lower = better)

2. **Readiness metrics:**
   - A(0): Should be near 0
   - A(5): Should be in [0,1]

3. **Curve metrics:**
   - Blue curve values at key timepoints
   - Green curve values (shifted by delay)
   - Implementation delay in years

4. **Acceptance test results:**
   - Boundedness verification
   - Reliability shift verification
   - Milestone calculations

- Seniority profiles and multipliers
- Implementation delay calculations
- Re-employment probability calculations

- ~~`hazardAI(t)`~~ → New logistic gate without time decay

### Legacy Functions (Kept but Unused)
- `dEff()` - kept for reference
- `A_explicit()` - kept for reference
