## Sheet 3: Seniority Adjustments

These are **additive modifiers** applied to the role baseline. Final values are clamped to [1, 5].

**Seniority Level** | **Label** | **Q7_adj** | **Q9_adj** | **Q10_adj** | **Q12_adj** | **Q17_adj** | **Q18_adj** | **Q19_adj** | **Reasoning**
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Entry Level | 0-2 years | 0 | 0 | -1 | 0 | -1 | 0 | 1 | Less institutional knowledge, fewer relationships, still building expertise. Below average performance relative to role.
Mid-Level | 3-7 years | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | Baseline competence. Average performance for the role.
Senior | 8-15 years | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | +1 | 0 | 4 | Deep expertise, established relationships, more context-dependent work. Above average performance.
Lead/Principal | 15-25 years | +2 | +2 | +2 | +1 | +1 | 0 | 5 | Specialized tacit knowledge, key stakeholder relationships, high trust requirements. Top performer.
Executive | 25+ years | +2 | +2 | +3 | +2 | +1 | 0 | 5 | Strategic relationships, governance oversight, irreplaceable institutional memory. Top performer.

### Notes on Adjustments:
- **Q7 (Context)**: More experience = more context dependency
- **Q9 (Tacit Knowledge)**: More experience = more undocumented expertise
- **Q10 (Relationships)**: Senior people have deeper stakeholder networks
- **Q12 (Trust)**: Senior roles often have higher governance/liability
- **Q17 (Transferability)**: Senior specialists may be more niche
- **Q18 (Adaptability)**: No adjustment - adaptability is personal, not seniority-based
- **Q19 (Performance)**: Progression from below average â†’ top performer

## Sheet 4: Slider Settings Reference

**Slider** | **Default** | **Range** | **Conservative** | **Moderate** | **Aggressive** | **Description**
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Doubling Period | 7 months | 3-18 months | 12 months | 7 months | 4 months | How fast AI capability doubles (from METR baseline)
Reliability Requirement | 0.95 (95%) | 0.80-0.99 | 0.98 | 0.95 | 0.90 | Success rate needed before automation
Compute Growth | Baseline | Conservative/Baseline/Aggressive | Conservative | Baseline | Aggressive | Scaling of compute resources
Industry Drag | Low | Low/Moderate/High | High | Moderate | Low | Regulatory/adoption friction

### Role-Specific Slider Recommendations:
- **Finance/Accounting, Legal**: Higher reliability (0.98) due to regulatory requirements
- **Creative/Design, Content Writing**: Lower reliability (0.90-0.92) - "good enough" threshold
- **Most roles**: Default 0.95 reliability

1. **Review & Adjust Role Baselines** (Sheet 1)
   - [ ] Validate Q1-Q20 values for each role
   - [ ] Check slider defaults make sense
   - [ ] Refine role descriptions

2. **Validate Seniority Logic** (Sheet 3)
   - [ ] Confirm adjustment logic makes sense
   - [ ] Test edge cases (Entry + High baseline values)

3. **Export to Code**
   - [ ] Convert Sheet 1 to JavaScript `ROLE_PRESETS` object
   - [ ] Convert Sheet 3 to JavaScript `SENIORITY_ADJUSTMENTS` object
   - [ ] Add preset application logic to index.html

4. **User Experience**
   - [ ] Add "Apply Preset" button after role/seniority selection
   - [ ] Show role description when preset is applied
   - [ ] Allow users to modify pre-filled answers
   - [ ] Add "Reset to Preset" option

## Notes on Scoring Philosophy

### High Scores (4-5) Indicate:
- **Q1-Q4**: Strong AI capability already exists
- **Q5-Q6**: Structured, repeatable work
- **Q7-Q12**: Protective factors (context, tacit knowledge, relationships)
- **Q13-Q16**: Conditions that accelerate adoption
- **Q17-Q20**: Factors improving job security/re-employment

### Calibration Targets:
- **Software/Tech**: Should show fastest displacement (many 5s in Q1-Q4, low in Q7-Q12)
- **Consulting/Strategy**: Should show moderate displacement (balanced scores)
- **Legal/Compliance**: Should show delayed displacement (high Q12, regulatory friction)
- **Content Writing**: Should show high technical feasibility but some implementation delay

### Cross-Validation:
After setting baselines, test a few combinations:
- Entry Software Engineer vs Senior Software Engineer
- Mid-Level Content Writer vs Executive Content Writer
- Compare against actual calculator results for reasonableness
