# WWILMJ PATCH IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
## Slider Direction & Weight Normalization (METR-patched, Oct 2025)

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

This patch fixes slider directions, normalizes weight handling, and corrects the BLUE pipeline order to ensure all sliders feel intuitive (right = more), removes reversed scales, and applies seniority in the correct stage of the pipeline.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Global Scoring Rule (index.html)

**Location:** `index.html:2637-2644` (codeAnswer function)

**Implementation:**
- All sliders now use uniform coding: `1→-2, 3→0, 5→+2`
- Direction determined by weight sign only
- No per-question reverse coding

```javascript
function codeAnswer(qid, raw) {
    if (typeof raw === 'number' && raw >= 1 && raw <= 5) return raw - 3;
    if (raw === true) return +1;
    if (raw === false) return -1;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 2. ✅ Question Registry Updates (index.html)

**Location:** `index.html:2591-2612` (QUESTION_WEIGHTS)

**Key Changes:**
- **Q5 (Task Decomposability):** `{ fric: -0.50 }` → `{ amp: +0.50 }`
  - Channel changed from friction to amplifier
  - Now increases risk as decomposability increases (1=complex → 5=structured)

- **Q12 (Physical Presence):** `{ amp: -0.60 }` → `{ fric: -0.60 }`
  - Channel changed from amplifier to friction
  - Maintains protective effect (higher presence = lower risk)

**Complete Registry:**
```javascript
const QUESTION_WEIGHTS = {
    // BLUE: Technical feasibility (amp increases risk, fric protects)
    Q1:  { amp: +0.80 },  // Current AI Performance
    Q2:  { amp: +0.40 },  // Data Availability
    Q3:  { amp: +0.35 },  // Benchmark Clarity
    Q4:  { amp: +0.55 },  // Task Digitization
    Q5:  { amp: +0.50 },  // Task Decomposability (FIXED)
    Q6:  { amp: +0.45 },  // Task Standardization
    Q7:  { fric: -0.50 }, // Context Dependency
    Q8:  { amp: +0.45 },  // Feedback Loop Speed
    Q9:  { fric: -0.40 }, // Tacit Knowledge
    Q10: { fric: -0.45 }, // Human Judgment & Relationships
    Q11: { fric: -0.85 }, // Union/Labor Protections
    Q12: { fric: -0.60 }, // Physical Presence (FIXED)
    Q13: { fric: -0.35 }, // Trust Requirements
};
```

### 3. ✅ BLUE Pipeline Order (index.html)

**Location:** `index.html:2947-2964` (getUserMultiplier)

**Pipeline Order:**
1. Compute question sums → clamp to [-2, +2]
2. Exponentiate: `ampMult = exp(ampSum)`, `fricMult = exp(fricSum)`
3. Multiply: `hazardMult = ampMult * fricMult`
4. **Apply seniority AFTER product:** `hazardMult *= (1 - hazardShield)`
5. Bound to [0.33, 3.00] (widened from [0.5, 2.0])

**Implementation:**
```javascript
function getUserMultiplier() {
    if (!currentParams) return 1.0;

    // Step 1: Compute question-based hazard multiplier
    const questionMultiplier = currentParams.ampMult * currentParams.fricMult;

    // Step 2: Apply seniority hazard shield AFTER question multiplier
    const profile = SENIORITY_PROFILES[...];
    const hazardMult = questionMultiplier * (1 - (profile.hazardShield || 0));

    // Step 3: Bound to [0.33, 3.0]
    return Math.max(0.33, Math.min(3.0, hazardMult));
}
```

**Seniority Hazard Shields:**
- Entry: 0.00 (no protection)
- Mid-Level: 0.05 (5% reduction)
- Senior: 0.10 (10% reduction)
- Lead/Principal: 0.14 (14% reduction)
- Executive: 0.18 (18% reduction)

### 4. ✅ GREEN Delay Formula (index.html)

**Location:** `index.html:2662-2677` (calculateImplementationDelay)

**Status:** Already correct, no changes needed

**Formula:**
```
delayScore = clamp(Σ weights × coded, -2, +2)
baseDelay = 1.75 - 1.25 × delayScore     // [0.5, 3.0]
delayYears = baseDelay + seniority.delayShift
delayYears = clamp(delayYears, 0.4, 4.0)
```

---

### 5. ✅ RE-EMPLOYMENT Calculation (index.html)

**Location:** `index.html:2682-2707` (calculateReemploymentProbability)

**Status:** Already correct, no changes needed

**Formula:**
```
baseProb = 0.6 + 0.2 × reemployScore
timingPenalty = {30% if <3y, 20% if <7y, 5% if <12y, 0% if ≥12y}
prob = (baseProb - penalty) × seniority.reEmployBoost
prob = clamp(prob, 0.10, 0.85)
```

---

### 6. ✅ UI Copy & Scale Labels (index.html)

**Location:** `index.html:1496-1545, 1691-1827`

**Q5 (Task Decomposability):**
- Before: `value=5` for "Very Complex", `value=1` for "Highly Structured"
- **After:** `value=1` for "Very Complex", `value=5` for "Highly Structured"
- Effect: Right slider = more structured = MORE risk ✓

**Q6 (Task Standardization):**
- Before: `value=5` for "Highly Variable", `value=1` for "Highly Standardized"
- **After:** `value=1` for "Highly Variable", `value=5` for "Highly Standardized"
- Effect: Right slider = more standardized = MORE risk ✓

**Q12 (Physical Presence):**
- Current: `value=1` for "None", `value=5` for "Essential"
- **Status:** Already correct (no change needed)
- Effect: Right slider = more physical = LESS risk ✓

**Q16 (Labor Market Tightness):**
- Current: `value=1` for "Very Easy", `value=5` for "Very Difficult"
- **Status:** Already correct (no change needed)
- Effect: Right slider = harder to hire = MORE delay ✓

**Removed Notes:**
- Deleted "REVERSED, needs negative weight" comment from Q16

### 7. ✅ Guide Explanations (guide.html)

**Location:** `guide.html:429-441`

**Updates:**
1. Added explicit coding rule documentation:
   > "All sliders use the same coding rule: Likert 1..5 responses convert to {-2,-1,0,+1,+2} (i.e., 1→-2, 3→0, 5→+2). Effects run in the correct direction via the weight's sign."

2. Updated pipeline description:
   > "After clamping each sum to [-2, 2] we exponentiate them, multiply the results, apply seniority hazard shield, then bound the overall multiplier to [0.33, 3.0] for responsiveness."

3. Corrected Q5/Q6 behavior:
   > "Task structure (Q5-Q9): structured, decomposable tasks (Q5, Q6 high) accelerate adoption via the amplifier channel..."

4. Updated calibration example:
   > "Setting Q1, Q4, and Q6 to five yields roughly a 2.5× hazard boost versus neutral answers, while stacking protective responses (Q7, Q9, Q12 high) suppresses the hazard by about 50% and delays implementation by ≥0.7 years."

### 8. ✅ Regression Tests (index.html)

**Location:** `index.html:2559-2692` (runPatchRegressionTests)

**Tests Added:**

1. **TEST 1: Q5 Direction**
   - Verifies Q5=1→5 increases hazardMult
   - Confirms decomposability now amplifies risk

2. **TEST 2: Q12 Direction**
   - Verifies Q12=1→5 decreases hazardMult
   - Confirms physical presence protects

3. **TEST 3: Q16 Direction**
   - Verifies Q16=1→5 increases delayYears
   - Confirms hiring difficulty delays adoption

4. **TEST 4: High-Risk Amplifier Stack**
   - Q1+Q4+Q6 at max should yield ≥2.5× hazard
   - Calibration check

5. **TEST 5: Protective Stack**
   - Q7+Q9+Q12 high + Q16 high should:
     - Suppress hazard ≤0.5×
     - Increase delay ≥0.7 years

6. **TEST 6: Q1 Swing Impact**
   - Q1 min→max should increase 2030 risk by ≥12pp

7. **TEST 7: Q11 Swing Impact**
   - Q11 low→high should decrease 2030 risk by ≤-10pp

**Test Execution:**
- Tests run automatically on page load
- Output to browser console
- Pass/fail indicators for each test

## Verification Steps

To verify the patch is working correctly:

1. **Open index.html in a browser**
2. **Open browser console** (F12)
3. **Check test output:**
   ```
   === WWILMJ PATCH REGRESSION TESTS ===

   TEST 1: Q5 direction (decomposability)
     RESULT: PASS ✓

   TEST 2: Q12 direction (physical presence)
     RESULT: PASS ✓

   ... (7 tests total)

   === PATCH TESTS: ALL PASSED ✓ ===
   ```

4. **Interactive Testing:**
   - Move Q5 slider right → risk should INCREASE
   - Move Q12 slider right → risk should DECREASE
   - Move Q16 slider right → delay should INCREASE
   - No sliders should feel "dead" or unresponsive

|----------|-------------------|------------|------------|----------|
| Q5       | More Structured   | ⚠️ DECREASE risk | ✅ INCREASE risk | YES |
| Q6       | More Standardized | ⚠️ DECREASE risk | ✅ INCREASE risk | YES |
| Q12      | More Physical     | ✅ DECREASE risk | ✅ DECREASE risk | NO (label was correct) |

## Known Limitations

None identified. All patch requirements have been implemented and tested.

## Notes for Future Maintenance

1. The `codeAnswer()` function is now the single source of truth for answer coding
2. All question effects are determined by weight sign, not scale reversal
3. Seniority is applied AFTER question multipliers in the hazard calculation
4. Regression tests will catch any future regressions to reversed scales
5. The [0.33, 3.00] bounds ensure all sliders remain responsive across the full range
