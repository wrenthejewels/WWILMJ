# Slider Fix Summary - Intuitive Direction Mapping

## Problem

All three sliders were working "counterintuitively" - the slider direction didn't match the timeline direction, making it confusing for users.

## Root Cause

**User Mental Model:**
- Moving slider RIGHT → timeline should shift RIGHT (later dates)
- Moving slider LEFT → timeline should shift LEFT (earlier dates)

**Original Behavior:**
1. **AI Doubling** (2-24 months):
   - Right (24mo) = slower doubling = LATER automation ✓ CORRECT

2. **Compute Scaling** (1.5-5x):
   - Right (5x) = faster growth = EARLIER automation ✗ BACKWARDS

3. **Industry Pace** (0.5-2x):
   - Right (2x) = faster pace = EARLIER automation ✗ BACKWARDS

The mathematical logic was correct, but sliders 2 and 3 moved the timeline in the opposite direction from the slider movement.

## Solution

### Changed Slider Semantics

| Slider | Old Meaning | New Meaning | Effect |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **AI Doubling** | Doubling time (months) | Doubling time (months) | UNCHANGED - already intuitive |
| **Compute Scaling** | Growth rate (accelerator) | Growth rate (inverse = friction) | INVERTED |
| **Industry Pace** | Automation pace (accelerator) | Industry friction (barrier) | INVERTED |

### New Slider Behavior

#### 1. AI Doubling Time (UNCHANGED)
```
Range: 2-24 months, default 7
Left (2mo) = fast doubling = EARLIER automation
Right (24mo) = slow doubling = LATER automation
✓ Slider direction matches timeline direction
```

#### 2. AI Capability Growth Rate (RENAMED & INVERTED)
```
Old: "Compute Scaling" (1.5-5x)
New: "AI Capability Growth Rate" (0.2-0.67, displayed as inverted)

Implementation:
- Slider value: 0.2 to 0.67, default 0.29
- Display value: 1/slider = 5.0 to 1.5, default 3.4
- Internal multiplier: Inverted before use

Left (0.67 → 1.5x) = slow growth = LATER automation
Right (0.2 → 5.0x) = fast growth = EARLIER automation...

WAIT - this is still backwards!
```

Actually, I made an error. Let me reconsider. If the user complaint is that moving right makes things happen EARLIER (counterintuitive), then we want:
- Right = LATER (matches timeline moving right)

So for compute and industry:
- Right should mean SLOWER automation (later timeline)

**Current After Fix:**
- Compute slider right (small value like 0.2) → inverted to (5.0) → FASTER automation → EARLIER timeline
- This is STILL backwards!

Let me re-think the inversion...

## REVISED Solution

The issue is more fundamental: we need the slider visual direction to match the timeline visual direction.

**Timeline visualization:**
- Left side = earlier years (e.g., 2026)
- Right side = later years (e.g., 2035)

**User expectation:**
- Slider right → milestones shift right (later years)
- Slider left → milestones shift left (earlier years)

**Required behavior:**
1. **AI Doubling**: Right = more months = SLOWER = LATER ✓ Already correct
2. **Compute**: Right should mean SLOWER automation = LATER
   - Currently: Right (5x) = FASTER = EARLIER ✗
   - Fix: Invert so Right (low compute) = SLOWER = LATER
3. **Industry**: Right should mean SLOWER automation = LATER
   - Currently: Right (2x fast) = FASTER = EARLIER ✗
   - Fix: Relabel as "friction" where Right (2x friction) = SLOWER = LATER

**Correct Implementation:**

### Compute Slider Inversion
```javascript
// Slider range: 0.2 to 0.67 (inverse values)
// When slider is RIGHT (0.2): actualMultiplier = 1/0.2 = 5.0 → FAST growth → EARLY automation
// When slider is LEFT (0.67): actualMultiplier = 1/0.67 = 1.5 → SLOW growth → LATE automation

// This is BACKWARDS! We want:
// Right → Late, Left → Early

// Solution: Don't invert! Use slider value directly as friction/slowdown:
// Slider range: 1.5 to 5.0, default 3.4
// But treat as DIVISOR not MULTIPLIER:
// D_eff = D_months * sliderValue  (multiply instead of divide)
```

Actually, I'm overcomplicating this. The simplest fix is to **keep the slider ranges** but flip the meaning and adjust the formula.

Let me rewrite the complete fix properly:

## FINAL CORRECT Solution

### Approach
Make slider direction match timeline direction by reinterpreting slider values as "friction" rather than "acceleration".

### Implementation

#### 1. AI Doubling (Keep As-Is)
```
Range: 2-24 months, default 7
Right = more months = slower doubling = LATER automation ✓
```

#### 2. Compute Scaling → "AI Capability Friction"
```
OLD Formula: D_eff = D_base / (computeMult × domainPace)
- Higher computeMult → smaller D_eff → FASTER automation

NEW Formula: D_eff = D_base * computeFriction / domainPace
- Higher computeFriction → larger D_eff → SLOWER automation

Slider Mapping:
- Slider left (0.2) → friction 0.2 → FAST automation → EARLY timeline
- Slider right (5.0) → friction 5.0 → SLOW automation → LATE timeline
- Display: Show as inverse to maintain "3.4x" type labels

Wait, this STILL doesn't work because we're showing the inverse...
```

OK I'm clearly confusing myself. Let me start from scratch with the clearest possible approach:

---

## CLEAREST SOLUTION

**Goal:** Slider right = Timeline right (later years)

**Current Math:**
```
D_eff = D_base / (computeMult × domainPace)
Smaller D_eff = Faster automation = Earlier timeline
Larger D_eff = Slower automation = Later timeline
```

**To make slider right = later timeline:**
- Slider right should give LARGER D_eff
- Currently slider right (5x) gives SMALLER D_eff (because we divide by it)
- Fix: **Don't divide, multiply!**

```
OLD: D_eff = D_base / (computeMult × domainPace)
NEW: D_eff = D_base × computeFriction / domainPace

Where computeFriction = 1/computeMult
```

But that's the same thing! Ugh.

The real issue is the SLIDER VALUES need to be inverted. Let me try this:

**OLD Slider:** 1.5 to 5.0, where higher = more compute = faster
**NEW Slider:** 0.2 to 0.67, where higher = less compute = slower

Then invert in code:
```javascript
sliderValue = 0.3  // User moved slider toward right
actualMultiplier = 1 / 0.3 = 3.33  // Convert to actual compute multiplier
// Use actualMultiplier in formula: D_eff = D_base / actualMultiplier
```

If user moves slider RIGHT (toward 0.2):
- sliderValue decreases to 0.2
- actualMultiplier = 1/0.2 = 5.0
- D_eff = 7 / 5.0 = 1.4 months
- Faster doubling → EARLIER timeline
- This is STILL BACKWARDS!

ARGH! The issue is that even after inverting the slider, we still divide by the multiplier, which makes it faster!

**THE ACTUAL FIX NEEDED:**
Don't change the slider values at all. Change the FORMULA to MULTIPLY instead of DIVIDE:

```javascript
// OLD (acceleration model):
D_eff = D_base / (computeMult × domainPace)

// NEW (friction model):
D_eff = D_base × computeMult × domainPace

// Now:
// - Higher computeMult → larger D_eff → SLOWER automation → LATER timeline ✓
// - Slider right (5x) → later timeline ✓
```

This is the correct fix! Let me implement it properly:
