# WWILMJ PATCH - Quick Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Slider Directions (index.html)
- **Q5 (Task Decomposability)**: Reversed values so 1=Complex, 5=Structured
- **Q6 (Task Standardization)**: Reversed values so 1=Variable, 5=Standardized
- Now "moving slider right" = "more of the named attribute" for ALL questions

### 2. Weight Channels (index.html)
- **Q5**: Changed from `fric: -0.50` to `amp: +0.50` (now amplifies risk)
- **Q12**: Changed from `amp: -0.60` to `fric: -0.60` (now friction/protective)

### 3. Seniority Application (index.html)
- Fixed pipeline order: questions → exp → multiply → **THEN seniority** → bounds
- Widened bounds from [0.5, 2.0] to [0.33, 3.0] for better responsiveness

### 4. Documentation (guide.html)
- Added explanation of uniform coding rule (1→-2, 3→0, 5→+2)
- Updated examples to reflect corrected Q5/Q6 behavior
- Fixed calibration test description

### 5. Tests (index.html)
- Added 7 regression tests (runPatchRegressionTests)
- Tests run automatically on page load
- Verify: Q5↑ increases risk, Q12↑ decreases risk, Q16↑ increases delay

## Verification

Open index.html in browser and check console for:
```
=== WWILMJ PATCH REGRESSION TESTS ===
TEST 1: Q5 direction (decomposability) - PASS ✓
TEST 2: Q12 direction (physical presence) - PASS ✓
...
=== PATCH TESTS: ALL PASSED ✓ ===
```
